# From Particles to Fluids: Dimensionality Reduction for Non-Maxwellian Plasma Velocity Distributions Validated in the Fluid Context

This code accompanies the NeurIPS 2022 paper of the above title. It trains a learned, patch-based, dimensionality reductive method for  plasma ion counts distributions using data from the MMS satellite mission's FPI/DIS instrument. It requires data from MMS FPI/DIS, available for free online at: [https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/](https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/).

A longer (>15 pages) paper on this work is currently under review with the journal *Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences.*
