# From Particles to Fluids: Dimensionality Reduction for Non-Maxwellian Plasma Velocity Distributions Validated in the Fluid Context

This code accompanies the NeurIPS 2022 conference proceeding paper of the above title. It also accompanies a full-length version of that paper published later that year in *Frontiers* journal, titled "***The Impact of Dimensionality Reduction of Ion Counts Distributions on Preserving Moments with Applications to Data Compression***". It trains a learned, patch-based, dimensionality reductive method for  plasma ion counts distributions using data from the MMS satellite mission's FPI/DIS instrument. It requires data from MMS FPI/DIS, available for free online at the [MMS Science Data Center](https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/).
