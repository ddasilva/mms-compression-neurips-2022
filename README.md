# From Particles to Fluids: Dimensionality Reduction for Plasma Velocity Distributions Validated in the Fluid Context


This code accompanies the NeurIPS 2022 paper of the above title. It trains a learned, patch-based, dimensionality reductive method for MMS FPI/DIS ion counts distributions. It requires data from MMS FPI/DIS, available for free online at: [https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/](https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/).
